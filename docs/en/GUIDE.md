## 🌟 Recommended Approach: Use 'Google Sites' Page as Start Page

### Why Google Sites?

**Technically simplest way to achieve focus mode in teaching when you don't want to/can't fully rely on an LMS:**

1. **One central landing page** - All lesson activities in one place
2. **Easy control** - Immediately see who's in SEB mode
3. **Flexible lesson planning** - Use different tools via links sequentially
4. **Control** - "Secret" URL prevents access outside SEB environment

### How does it work?

```
Student starts .seb file
    ↓
Automatically opens your Google Sites page
    ↓
Student clicks links to activities (Kahoot, Mentimeter, etc.)
    ↓
Everything works - only allowed domains accessible
    ↓
No distractions (YouTube, social media blocked)
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

4. **Configure visibility, publish and copy URL:**
   - Select **"Publish"**
   - ❌ **Don't allow search indexing**
   - ⚠️ **Suggested URL:** `Subject_Class_Date` + **secret string** (e.g., `sites.google.com/view/English_G22e_2025-11-10xy7z3abc`)
   - **Copy URL** - you'll need it for the generator

---

### Step 2: Open Generator
Go to: `https://focusmode.ch`

Alternative (offline): Download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/markuskiller/SEBConfigGenerator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it, and open `index.html` locally in your browser.

---

⚠️ **Privacy:** With both methods, **no data is transmitted**, all processing happens **locally in your browser**. This can be verified through code review, e.g., by common generative AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini, ...). The entire code is open source and available at [github.com/markuskiller/SEBConfigGenerator](https://github.com/markuskiller/SEBConfigGenerator).

---

### Step 3: Select Services (multiple possible!)

**Without Login:**
- **Whiteboard.fi** - Collaborative whiteboard
- **Kahoot!** - Quizzes and surveys
- **Mentimeter** - Live polls
- **Slido** - Q&A and polls
- **Microsoft Forms** - Public surveys
- **Padlet** - Digital pinboard
- **Miro** - Digital whiteboard
- **Etherpad** - Text collaboration

**With Login:**
- **OneNote Online** - For digital notebooks
- **Word Online** - For document editing

For the above English lesson example, the following services are selected:
- Kahoot
- Mentimeter
- Padlet

### Step 4: Start URL and Custom Domains

1. **Enter start URL:**
   ```
   https://sites.google.com/view/your-secret-page-xyz123
   ```

For the above example: `sites.google.com/view/English_G22e_2025-11-10xy7z3abc`

### Step 5: Continue with Default Values

For a working SEB configuration template, the default values can usually be used unchanged. Fine-tuning can be done in the SEB Config Tool.

### Step 6: Download Configuration
Click: **"📥 Download SEB Configuration (.seb)"**

Saved as `Multi_Service_Config.seb` (multiple services), `[Service]_Config.seb` (selected service), or under the manually entered filename.

---

⚠️ **Important:** The downloaded .seb file is only a template! The following steps must be completed before the configuration can be used productively in class and distributed to students.

---

### Step 7: Import and Finalize in SEB Config Tool

1. Download [SEB Config Tool](https://safeexambrowser.org/download_en.html) (one-time setup)
2. Open **SEB Config Tool**
3. **File → Open** → Select your downloaded `.seb` file
4. **Tab 'General' → Review and refine settings:**
   - Add administrator password (needed to modify configuration file later)
   - Add quit password (='Quit/unlock password') (if desired)
   - Configure additional restrictions
5. **Tab 'Config' → Encrypt configuration & set START password:**
   - Configure → Encrypt with password and/or certificate
   - **⚠️ The 'SETTINGS' password is also the START password for students**
6. **Save as final .seb file:**
   - File → Save as → `[Subject]_[Class]_[Date]_[Topic].seb` (e.g., `English_G22e_2025-11-15_Conditionals.seb`)

**Important:** Only distribute the encrypted, finalized `.seb` file to students!

### Step 8: Test & Distribute

**Testing - ⚠️ Before distributing to students:**

1. Install SEB on your computer
2. Double-click your final `.seb` configuration file
3. Try to:
   - Log in with a STUDENT (TEST) ACCOUNT (not with teacher account)
   - Access shared resources
   - Type and save something, if applicable
   - If creating/visiting links via a shared page is possible, try to access a page that should be blocked (e.g., MS Teams)

**If something doesn't work:** See troubleshooting below

**Distribute to students:**

It's often useful to install [Safe Exam Browser](https://safeexambrowser.org/download_en.html) together in class (once per semester or when a new version is available).

The encrypted configuration file can be distributed via the usual communication channel with file exchange capability (e.g., MS Teams, Google Classroom, or email).

**Important:** Filename should clearly indicate what the configuration is for: `English_G22e_2025-11-15_Conditionals.seb`

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Can't log in" or "Page won't load"

**Probable cause:** Missing authentication domains

**Solution:**
1. Go to **"Network Capture"** tab in the tool
2. Follow the Fiddler instructions
3. Upload the capture file
4. Add discovered domains to configuration

**Or:** Ask IT to check school firewall settings and assist with analyzing necessary domain connections.

---

### Problem: "MFA/Two-Factor Authentication doesn't work"

**Solution:** Add all necessary domains in the "Custom Domains" section. Follow the instructions in the 'Network Capture' section:

**For Microsoft (e.g.):**
```
*.msftauth.net
*.msauth.net
login.microsoftonline.com
...
```

**For Google (e.g.):**
```
accounts.google.com
*.googleusercontent.com
...
```

---

### Problem: "Too restrictive / Students are frustrated"

**Solution:**
1. Switch from "Strict" → "Balanced" or "Relaxed"
2. Enable more options (downloads, reload, etc.)

**Remember:** On personal devices, determined students can always circumvent restrictions if they have enough knowledge, time & motivation. That's okay - it's about **focus**, not primarily **surveillance**. Such problems must be solved on a pedagogical level.

---

### Problem: "Students still access social media"

**Solution:**
1. Switch to "Balanced" or "Strict"
2. Ensure URL filtering is enabled

**Remember:** On personal devices, determined students can always circumvent restrictions if they have enough knowledge, time & motivation. That's okay - it's about **focus**, not primarily **surveillance**. Such problems must be solved on a pedagogical level.

---

### Problem: "File downloads don't work"

**Solution:**
1. Edit configuration
2. ✅ Enable "Allow downloads"
3. Regenerate and test

---

## Advanced: Add Custom Service

**Example:** You want to allow Wikipedia for quizzes

1. Go to the tool
2. In **"Custom Domains"** section, add:
```
en.wikipedia.org
```

3. Set Wikipedia as start URL or link to `https://en.wikipedia.org` within already shared resources (e.g., on the Google Sites landing page)
4. Generate configuration

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do students need to install something?**
A: Yes, Safe Exam Browser (free download)

**Q: Does this work on phones/tablets?**
A: Not on all tablets, SEB is available for Windows/macOS and iPadOS.

**Q: Can students uninstall it afterwards?**
A: Yes! It's just an app. Encourage students to keep it for future use.

**Q: Is this secure enough for final exams?**
A: **No.** Use this on students' BYOD devices only for classwork, not for important summative assessments.

**Q: What if students don't have their own device or forgot it?**
A: Use school computers if possible.

**Q: Can I edit an existing configuration?**
A: Yes! Open the `.seb` file in SEB Config Tool to make changes (but be sure to encrypt before distributing to students!)

**Q: Do I need the SEB Config Tool?**
A: **Yes!** The generator creates a template that must be refined, encrypted, and finalized in the Config Tool before distribution.

**Q: Why do I need to encrypt the configuration?**
A: Encryption prevents students from changing settings and ensures the configuration cannot be easily circumvented. Additionally, the 'Settings' password serves as the **START password** for focus mode.
