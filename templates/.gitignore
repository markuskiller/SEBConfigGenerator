# Template System Structure
#
# Source files (JSON/XML) should be committed - these are the "source of truth"
# Generated files (.js) should also be committed for production deployment
# 
# This .gitignore is here for documentation purposes only.
# Currently, both source and generated files are committed.

# If you want to generate files during CI/CD instead:
# Uncomment the following line to ignore generated files:
# generated/*.js
